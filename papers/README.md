# Reading Strategy:

1. define learning problem
2. Mathematically describe what kernel method(s) is/are used.
  - Dot product as well as feature map
  - Kernel composition
3. Describe how the model is trained
  - Optimization method (Layer-wise vs Backprop)
  - Loss function: What is being measured?
  - Regularization methods
4. Formulate if it is easy to implement based on current implemenations
